FileXOR SEQ [OFFSET] [FILENUM]

    Any read operation (Get, *Log and so on) on any file will
    also perform the XORing of the read data with the numbers
    contained in the given string or in the given variable.
    The OFFSET field by default is zero which means that if the
    data must be xored with more than one byte (a "xor key") the
    first byte of the key is the first byte at OFFSET which is 0
    by default (beginning of the file).
    Recap: the FileXOR command works with ANY file access.

    Arguments:
      SEQ       Sequence of space-separated 8bit numbers, like:
                - asequence of bytes separated by space like 0x12
                  or "0x12 0x34 0x56" or directly a C hex string
                  like "\x12\x34\x56" (NOT a C notation!)
                - a numeric variable like MYXORKEY
                - a string not starting with numbers, '\' or '-'
                Currently it's not possible to use a key in string
                mode and use the Encryption command for doing it,
                so if you have a string convert it to a numeric
                sequence first or be sure that it doesn't start
                with the chars shown above.
                Set it to 0 or "" for disabling the xor.
                Note that SEQ can be also a 32bit signed number
                like filexor 0x11223344 but the size is decided by
                value so 0x00000022 is 8 bit and not 32, while
                -0x20 is considered 8bit and 0x80112233 a 32bit.
      OFFSET    Needed only for the xor key offset.
                If the archive is xored with a xor key from its
                beginning (so first byte of the archive xored with
                the first one of the key) this argument is usually
                not necessary
                Instead if only the file to extract is xored, this
                argument must have the same offset of the file (so
                just reuse the same OFFSET used in Log)
      FILENUM   By default FileXOR is applied to ALL the files and
                OFFSET (if specified) is referred to file 0.
                When FILENUM is specified, it will only be applied
                to that specific file.

    Examples:
      filexor 0xff
      filexor -0x20
      filexor 0x1122    # 32bit
      filexor -0x1122   # 32bit
      filexor "0x12 0x34 123 255"
      filexor MYXORBYTE
      saepos OFFSET
      filexor "0x12 0x34 123 255" OFFSET
      filexor "\x12\x34\x7b\xff"
      Log NAME OFFSET SIZE
