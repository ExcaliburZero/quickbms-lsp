GetDString VAR LENGTH [FILENUM]

    It reads a defined amount of data from the file and stores it
    in the given variable.
    It's useful with filenames and other strings that have a length
    specified in a previous 8, 16 or 32 bit field.

    Arguments:
      VAR       Variable which will receive the read data
      LENGTH    Amount of bytes to read.
                There is also an experimental method in which you
                can specify the elements and their size like
                LENGTH*NUM, for example:
                  getdstring ARRAY NUMBERS*4
      FILENUM   Number of the file associated to the archive (0)

    Examples:
      GetDString NAME NAME_LENGTH
      GetDString NAME 0x100
      getdstring ARRAY ELEMENTS*4
