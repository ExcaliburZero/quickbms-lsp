GetVarChr VAR VAR OFFSET [TYPE]

    A particular and sometimes very useful command which works
    exactly like accessing an array of elements contained in the
    second variable, for example a string or a memory file.
    It can be compared to C as: var1 = var2[offset];
    This simple and effective method allows the manipulation of
    strings and variables for creating custom headers (like a DDS)
    and moreover for performing operations on a piece of the
    memory, like a custom encryption algorithm.
    Some real examples are my Deer Hunter 2004/2005 scripts.

    Arguments:
      VAR       Destination variable that will contain the element
      VAR       Variable or memory file from which you want to get
                the element
      OFFSET    Position of the element in the second variable
      TYPE      Type of the element to read and assign to the first
                variable, if not specified it's a BYTE (8bit).
                You can specify most of the available datatypes
                like short, long, longlong and so on

    Examples:
      For i = 0 < SIZE
          GetVarChr TMP MEMORY_FILE i
          GetVarChr TMP MEMORY_FILE i long
          # GetVarChr TMP MEMORY_FILE i string
      Next i
