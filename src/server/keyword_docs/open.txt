Open FOLDER NAME [FILENUM] [EXISTS]

    It opens a file, basically it assigns a file number/id to an
    existent file that you want to use.
    If NAME is '?':
    - and FOLDER is FDDE the user must type the extension of the
      file to load, the name is the same of the one currently open
    - and FOLDER is FDSE the user must type the name of the file
      loaded from the same folder
    - the user must type the full name of the file to load
    From version 0.9 QuickBMS has introduced the emulated file
    number 0, if you use "open MEMORY_FILE" or "open 1" then any
    operation on the current file will be performed on the chosen
    file, use "open 0" to restore it.

    Arguments:
      FOLDER    FDDE, means that you want to open the file in the
                  same location of the input one which has the
                  extension provided with NAME, so FDDE is for the
                  extension only
                FDSE, it will consider NAME as a file located in
                  the same folder of the input file (very useful)
                FDDE2, like FDDE forcing the original input folder
                FDSE2, like FDSE forcing the original input folder
                any other value is considered the folder where is
                  located the file to load so use "." for the
                  current output folder
      NAME      Read above, NAME can also be a ? in which case
                QuickBMS will ask the user to insert the name of
                the file to open manually if NAME is "" then will
                be performed a flush operation that could be useful
                (or not?) only in write mode (debug)
      FILENUM   Number of the file associated to the archive (0)
      EXISTS    If the file doesn't exist this variable will be set
                to 0 or 1 if it exists. By default QuickBMS
                terminates with an error if the file doesn't exist.

    Examples:
      Open FDDE DAT 0
      Open FDDE IDX 1
      Open FDSE "myfile.zip"
      Open "." TEMPORARY_FILE 1
