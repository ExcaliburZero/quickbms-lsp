PutVarChr VAR OFFSET VAR [TYPE]

    The "write-mode" alternative of the previous command which
    allows to perform various complex operations with custom
    algorithms (like in my Deer Hunter 2004/2005 scripts).
    It can be compared to C as: var1[offset] = var2;
    Note that PutVarChr can be also used as an allocator of memory
    that is often useful in the implementation of custom
    decompression algorithms or, moreover, for pre-allocating a
    MEMORY_FILE for storing chunks. This is useful to avoid wasting
    time and memory with the incremental allocation, remember only
    to use the command "Log MEMORY_FILE 0 0" after it for resetting
    the position of the MEMORY_FILE.

    arguments
      VAR       Variable or memory file in which you want to put
                the element
      OFFSET    Position of the output where placing the element,
                it can also be negative in which case it will work
                from the end of the variable (may not work in some
                conditions)
      VAR       Source variable which will contain the element to
                write, it's also possible to store the address of
                the variable which may be useful with external DLLs
      TYPE      Type of the element to read and assign to the first
                variable, if not specified it's a BYTE (8bit).
                You can specify most of the available datatypes
                like short, long, longlong and so on.

    Examples:
      For i = 0 < SIZE
          GetVarChr TMP MEMORY_FILE i
          Math TMP ^= 0xff
          PutVarChr MEMORY_FILE i TMP
      Next i
