Log NAME OFFSET SIZE [FILENUM] [XSIZE]

    It extracts the file, this operation doesn't change the current
    position of the input file.
    The content of the extracted file can be automatically
    decrypted using the Encryption command before it.
    If NAME is an empty string like "", QuickBMS will assign a
    sequential hexadecimal number and will try to guess the
    extension based on the content at the beginning of the file.
    The extension will be automatically guessed and appended also
    to all the files that terminate with a dot or an asterisk like
    ".", "*" or ".*" or if they point to folders like "folder/".
    NAME can also be a special file like those that we will see
    later like a socket, a process, an audio device and so on (they
    require previous authorization by the user via command-line).
    The filename will be automatically cleaned for dumping the file
    without problems.
    NAME can also be a MEMORY_FILE or a TEMPORARY_FILE.
    If a file with the same name already exists, QuickBMS will ask
    what action to take, the suggested one is the 'r' choice that
    will allow to automatically rename all the files with the same
    name without overwriting them.
    If you have used the Append command, the data will be appended
    to the existent file with the same name.
    Log and Clog share the same code, so the compression is the only
    difference.

    Arguments:
      NAME      Name of the output file
      OFFSET    Position in the archive where is located the file
      SIZE      Amount of the data to extract
      FILENUM   Number of the file associated to the archive (0)
      XSIZE     Used with block encryptions, this value is the aligned
                amount of data read from the disk, example for AES:
                   log NAME OFFSET 0x123      0 0x130
                  clog NAME OFFSET 0x123 SIZE 0 0x130

    Examples:
      Log NAME OFFSET SIZE
      Log "dump.dat" 0 SIZE
      Log "" 0 SIZE
      Log "folder/name.*" 0 SIZE
