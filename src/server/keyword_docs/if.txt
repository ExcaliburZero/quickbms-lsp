If VAR COND VAR [...]
...
[Elif VAR COND VAR]
...
[Else]
...
EndIf

    It checks various conditions and performs the needed operation
    when the condition is verified, in short:
    - If is ever the first condition
    - Elif is another condition and can be used endless times
    - Else is the operation to do when no conditions are met, last
    - EndIf delimits the If command statement
    It's also possible to use multiple conditions (max 4) like:
      if VAR1 < VAR2 && VAR3 > VAR4
      elif VAR1 != 0 || VAR2 != 0
    The 'u' added before the condition forces an unsigned
    comparison with numbers and a case sensitive one with strings.
    The condition is considered for both strings and numbers, for
    more technical details check the check_condition() function
    in the cmd.c source code.

    Arguments:
      VAR       First part of the condition
      COND      Valid for both strings and numbers:
                <   minor, lower, below
                >   major, greater, above
                !=  different, <> !==
                ==  equal, = === strcmp stricmp strcasecmp
                >=  major/equal
                <=  minor/equal
                &   string: var2 is included in var1 (strstr)
                    number: logical AND
                ^   string: equal
                    number: logical XOR
                |   number: logical OR
                %   number: modulus
                /   number: division
                <<  number: shift left
                >>  number: shift right
                !   number: negation, not
                !!  number: true, use it to know if VAR is non-zero
                ~   number: complement
                strncmp     if "mystring" strncmp "myst"
                ext compares the string after the last dot
                basename    compares the string before the last dot
                filepath    compares the part before the filenames,
                            you can force a folder without filename
                            by appending a slash: "c:\folder/"
                            instead of "c:\folder" (will be "c:")
                any other operation supported by the Math command
                  (valid only for the numeric variables)
                use 'u' before COND for forcing the usage of
                unsigned operations useful with shift, divisions
                and possibly other operations, if the variables
                are strings then it will perform an case sensitive
                comparison instead of the default insensitive one,
                while the '0' prefix before COND works just like in
                String performing a binary comparison
      VAR       Second part of the condition

    Examples:
      If NAME != ""
          ...
      Endif
      If MASK & 1
      Elif MASK & 2
      Elif MASK & 4
      Elif MASK & 8
      Else
      Endif
