Padding VAR [FILENUM] [BASE_OFF]

    When called it performs an automatic GoTo to the next position
    of the file skipping the aligned data.
    Imagine to have a file where it's used an alignment of 4 bytes
    and your current file offset is 0x39, if you use Padding 4 the
    offset will be automatically changed to 0x3c.
    By default the padding is referred to the beginning of the file
    (offset 0).

    Arguments:
      VAR       Size of the alignment, like 4 or 16 and so on
      FILENUM   Number of the file associated to the archive (0)
      BASE_OFF  base offset from where calculating the padding (0)

    Examples:
      Get NAME string
      Padding 4
      get OFFSET long
