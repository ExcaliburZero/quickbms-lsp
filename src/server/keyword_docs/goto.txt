GoTo OFFSET [FILENUM] [TYPE]

    It changes the current position in the file, like fseek in C.

    Arguments:
      OFFSET    Position to reach.
                The offset "SEEK_SET" is offset 0.
                The offset "SEEK_END" is the end of file.
                If it's a constant negative it will be considered
                the amount of bytes from the end of the file, so a
                negative variable is considered as unsigned 32bit.
                The offset depends also by the TYPE field.
      FILENUM   number of the file associated to the archive (0)
      TYPE      - SEEK_SET, absolute offset (default)
                - SEEK_CUR, relative offset from current position
                - SEEK_END, amount of bytes from the end, must be
                  negative or OFFSET will be converted to negative

    Examples:
      GoTo OFFSET
      GoTo 0x100
      GoTo -4           # 4 bytes before the end of the file
      GoTo SEEK_SET     # like goto 0
      Goto SEEK_END     # like goto 0 0 SEEK_END
