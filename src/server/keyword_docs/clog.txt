Clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE [FILENUM] [XSIZE]

    It extracts the file decompressing it in real-time, this
    operation doesn't change the current position of the file.
    The decompression algorithm used in the operation is decided by
    the ComType command which is zlib by default.
    The content of the extracted file can be decrypted
    automatically after decompression using the Encryption command.
    For additional information please refer to the Log command.

    Arguments:
      NAME      Name of the output file
      OFFSET    Position of the archive where is located the file
      ZSIZE     Size of the compressed data in the archive
      SIZE      Size of the uncompressed file, if you have used a
                "_compress" algorithm then use SIZE equal to ZSIZE
                because the tool will automatically calculate the
                maximum amount of bytes taken for the compression
      FILENUM   Number of the file associated to the archive (0)
      XSIZE     Used with block encryptions like AES, just like Log

    Examples:
      Clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE
      Clog "dump.dat" 0 ZSIZE 10000000
        # with some compression algorithms the file will have the
        # real size while others will set it to 10000000
