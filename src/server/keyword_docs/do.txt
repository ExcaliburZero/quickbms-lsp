Do

While VAR COND VAR

    A less useful type of cycle where the check of the condition is
    performed at the end of the cycle... really rarely used.
    If you need a C-like "while(...) {...}" use the For command.

    Arguments:
      VAR       first part of the condition
      COND      condition, check the If command below for more info
      VAR       second part of the condition

    Examples:
      Do
          ...
      While OFFSET < MAX_OFFSET
